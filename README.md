## Project setup
Clone or download the project to your local workspace. From there, install the project using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm.</a>
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
There is not a ui (user interface) for this project. However this command will allow you to run a local version of the project for development purposes.
The default localhost url is: http://localhost:8080/
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
Creates a `dist` directory for deployment purposes.
```
npm run build
```

### Compiles and minifies for production for modern browsers
Creates a `dist` directory for deployment purposes. Newer bundling methods will be leveraged for newer browser support. This will also generate `.legacy` files to support legacy browsers.
```
npm run build-modern
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Run your end-to-end tests
Because there is no ui (user interface) there are no tests located here.
```
npm run test:e2e
```

### Run your unit tests
Runs all unit tests located in `/tests/unit/*.spec.js`
```
npm run test:unit
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
